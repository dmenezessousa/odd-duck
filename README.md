First lab - Display img side by side with an onclick handler after 25 clicks show a list with the data on which img was clicked

Second lab - When image reaches 25 clicks user can no longer vote/click on an image button count shows view results and now it shows a table with the data.

Third lab - same steps as above, however now we display the table + a Chart with graph showing which img was clicked and viewd.
